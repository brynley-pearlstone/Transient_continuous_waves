Need to write a code

loop from 0 to number of sims

Collate error statistics from each simulation
	Don't do as parallel - could cause awful overwrite error

change path to loop iteration number
call analysis file

Go into output file
Read sorted_binaries - go to last entry, store it
Read input binary
number_wrong_places[i] = abs(found_binaries[j] - true_binary[j])
append to file of number_wrong_places

From the output - read the position
append to file of position


Take list averages
