% This script is to find the probability of obtaining any one of the 256
% 8-bit binary unmbers which could constitute a changepoint configuration.
% We define \Gamma as the 8 bit number, and \gamma_i as each bimary element
% of \Gamma.

% We can define the probability of \gamma_i as

% P_gamma = (1/(((2*pi)^-0.5)*sigma))*exp((-(D-gamma_i*h)^2)/(2*sigma^2));

% Now we can define some other things. for example, D is fed forward from
% the CW analysis. Sigmma may be given (look into feed forward from CW
% analysis), h fed forward from CW analysis

% We compute the probability for each of the 256 8-bit numbers

% Call function to break up data into 8 equal length segments

% Call script to run CW code on each of the 8 segments
