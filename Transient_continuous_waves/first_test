% This script is to find the probability of obtaining any one of the 256
% 8-bit binary unmbers which could constitute a changepoint configuration.
% We define \Gamma as the 8 bit number, and \gamma_i as each bimary element
% of \Gamma.

% We can define the probability of \gamma_i as

P_gamma = (1/(((2*pi)^-0.5)*sigma))*exp((-(D-gamma_i*h)^2)/(2*sigma^2));

% Now we can define some other things. for example, D is fed forward from
% the CW analysis. Sigmma may be given (look into feed forward from CW
% analysis), h fed forward from CW analysis

% We compute the probability for each of the 256 8-bit numbers

bit_list = str2num(dec2bin([0:255]))

for item in bin_list;
    while length(item)>8;
        item = cat(0, item, 1);
        
    end
end
